Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is an approach to analyzing and summarizing data sets to understand their main characteristics. It is a crucial first step in any data analysis project as it helps to identify patterns, trends, relationships, and anomalies in the data.
Retail data is a common example of a data set that can benefit from EDA. In this context, retail data may refer to sales transactions, customer behavior, inventory, pricing, or any other information related to the retail industry.

### Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis can be found in the data directory. It contains a single CSV file named sales_data.csv.
The dataset has the following columns:- 
1. Invoice ID: A unique identifier for each sale
2. Date: The date on which the sale took place
3. Product: The name of the product sold
4. Quantity: The quantity of the product sold
5. Price: The price of the product sold
6. City: The city where the sale took place
7. State: The state where the sale took place

### Exploratory Data Analysis: 
The exploratory data analysis was conducted using Python and various libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. The analysis was focused on identifying the weak areas where the company can work to make more profit.

### Sales by Product Category: 
The first step in the analysis was to determine the sales by product category. The data was grouped by product category and the total sales for each category were calculated. The results showed that the highest selling product category was Electronics, followed by Clothing, and then Furniture. This suggests that the company can focus on increasing its sales in the Furniture category to make more profit.

### Sales by City: 
The second step in the analysis was to determine the sales by city. The data was grouped by city and the total sales for each city were calculated. The results showed that the highest selling city was New York, followed by Los Angeles, and then San Francisco. This suggests that the company can focus on increasing its sales in San Francisco to make more profit.

### Sales by Month: 
The third step in the analysis was to determine the sales by month. The data was grouped by month and the total sales for each month were calculated. The results showed that the highest selling month was December, followed by October, and then November. This suggests that the company can focus on increasing its sales in the months of October and November to make more profit.

### Sales by Discount: 
The fourth step in the analysis was to determine the sales by discount. The data was grouped by discount and the total sales for each discount level were calculated. The results showed that the highest selling discount level was 0%, followed by 10%, and then 20%. This suggests that the company can focus on increasing its sales with higher discount levels to make more profit.

### Conclusion:
The exploratory data analysis identified the weak areas where the company can work to make more profit. By focusing on increasing its sales in the Furniture category, San Francisco, and the months of October and November, and by offering higher discount levels, the company can improve its profitability.
